\details{
This is an incomplete sample of the 2017 Chicago Police Department crime data released via the City of Chicago data portal (\url{https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/City-of-Chicago-Crime-Data/v9q9-3dm2}). Many location coordinates are missing or incomplete, and some records have minimal or blank location fields.
